I had been using the MD390 V1.36 CPS without any problems to read/write to my MD380 ***BUT*** they have changed menu entries for the side buttons so now there is NO Zone Select and only a Zone Toggle available which is what I was unknowingly using expecting the results of Zone Select.

Now using CPS MD380 V1.32 and everything works as it should...although the Zone Toggle is quite a nice feature.

In folder C:\TYT\CPS MD390 V1.36   open setting.ini and change MD380 to MD390 like this :
[setup]
language=english
testmode=0
model=MD380
oemmodel=MD380
oemindex=255
windowtext=CPS MD380
